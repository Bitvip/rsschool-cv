I want to self-develop and continue to find a job.

HTML, CSS, JS basics,PHP basics, ะก# and C++ basics.

Latest projects:
```
 $sth = $dbh->prepare("SELECT * FROM `b_iblock_element` WHERE `XML_ID` = ?");
 $sth->execute(array($article));
 $prod = $sth->fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);

 if (!empty($prod)) {
   $sth = $dbh->prepare("UPDATE `b_catalog_price` SET `price` = ?,`price_scale`=? WHERE `PRODUCT_ID` = ?");
   $sth->execute(array($price,$price,$prod['ID']));
 }
 ```
From personal experience, this is development in C # term papers and a diploma.(https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1j-eemCde8-eP8t1Q9tyNhmm0vldVDmkl)
